    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">1. No Conversation History Storage</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">

    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">2. Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
        To differentiate between users during active sessions, we use a cookie called <code class="bg-gray-200 p-1 rounded">chat_id</code>. This cookie is short-lived and automatically expires after a brief period, ensuring minimal data retention. The <code class="bg-gray-200 p-1 rounded">chat_id</code> cookie is not used for tracking or personal identification beyond managing active sessions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">3. Google Analytics</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
        We use Google Analytics to gather anonymized data about how users interact with our service. This data helps us improve the service and user experience. Google Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information in this process.

        By using our service, you acknowledge and agree to the use of these limited cookies and analytics for service improvement purposes. If you have any concerns regarding our data handling practices, please contact us.
